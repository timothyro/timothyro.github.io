Being a computer science student, I am getting pretty used to learning new programming languages every semester. When I was first getting into programming and computer science, I thought Java and Javascript were the same thing (which I now know is not the case). This class is not the very first time I have worked with Javascript, I have a few weeks of experience with it from high school. So far the programming languages I have worked with are Scratch, Python, Javascript, and HTML/CSS in high school and Java, C, and C++ in college. Back in high school I didn't really get into Javascript libraries because it was only being taught as an introduction to program theory. I don't really remember much from my time working with Javascript in high school, but I have a pretty good idea of what to make a program do to solve a problem. As long as I refresh my memory on the syntax of whatever language I am working with.

This class was the first time I even looked at Javascript for about 3 years, so it felt a little new again and I actually learned a good amount from the freecodecamp lessons. I usually would have just breezed through them because they were mostly easy problems that took less than a minute each, but for many of them, I took a few extra minutes to try and get used to syntax differences from Javascript to C and C++ that we used in ICS 212 (my most recent computer science class). There were a few things that were basically the same like while/for loops, if statements, and logical/arithmetic operators to name a few. There were many things that were different, for example: functions, not having declared variable types, and back ticks for quotes and inserting variables. Comparing what little I know of Javascript now to what I learned of C and C++ last semester, I think Javascript looks easier to read, allows for arrays with multiple data types, and prototype inheritance makes classes simpler than many other languages.

For the first two practice WODs "E07: Project Euler Problem 1" and "E08: isUnique" I thought out a solution in my head within a few minutes, but I had to look up how to write them out in Javascript. I was able to create the structure of the function required for E07 in about a minute, but on my first attempt, it took me a while on my first attempt because I tried using a while loop and got the wrong answer so I had to go back and fix it with a for loop which ended up taking almost 7 minutes which was not DNF (8 min) according to the time rubric, but I wanted to get my time to at least the Av (4-6 min)
