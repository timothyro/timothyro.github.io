<h2>I've never even heard of a design pattern</h2>
I've only been an ICS major for 2 years, but the words "design pattern" had never reached my ears before the start of the design patterns module. When I first heard about them, I just assumed they meant the way the code was displayed to a user like most web page having a navbar and a footer or something. After watching the screencasts and looking back at some of the projects that we worked on earlier in the semester, I can say that design patterns are much more high level than that. Content that is displayed on a web page is only a single example of a design pattern, but my original perspective was too narrow. Design patterns are not only limited to front end user interfaces, but can also include back end logic. From what I got from the first screencast, design patterns are just general solutions to common problems that occcur in software engineering that can be modified to be applied to actual code. A design pattern introduced in that screencast that I found interesting was the MVC since it was said that anyone who had worked on a website has already experienced it.

<h2>My code already has design patterns in it?</h2>
