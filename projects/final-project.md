<h2>Overview</h2>
The Over Da Rainbow web application is a place for UH students and faculty to find locations around the island on and off of campus. The user can also create their own account with their name, bio, and social media as well as post messages to the message board and plan events at certain locations. The location pages are split into 5 sections: beaches, hikes, views, campus spots, and volunteer opportunities and the locations themselves were chosen to be appealing to college students.

<h2>Contributions</h2>
We worked on this project in 3 iterations, that we called milestones, over about a month to end up with out end product. For the first milestone my contributions were creating the footer and the template for the 5 pages (beaches, hikes, views, spots, and volunteer) that list locations.
