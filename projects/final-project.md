<h2>Overview</h2>
The Over Da Rainbow web application is a place for UH students and faculty to find locations around the island on and off of campus. The user can also create their own account with their name, bio, and social media as well as post messages to the message board and plan events at certain locations. The location pages are split into 5 sections: beaches, hikes, views, campus spots, and volunteer opportunities and the locations themselves were chosen to be appealing to college students.

<h2>Contributions</h2>
We worked on this project in 3 iterations, that we called milestones, over about a month to end up with out end product. For the first milestone my contributions were creating the footer and the template for the 5 pages (beaches, hikes, views, spots, and volunteer) that list locations.
<h4>Footer</h4>

For the second milestone my contributions were creating a page for each location after clicking on a card, create a bulletin board page, and create an option for admin users to add a new location.

For the third and final milestone my contributions were to give admin users an option to edit and delete each location from its' page and create a new section to the bulletin board to allow users to plan events for others to go to.

<h2>Learning Experience</h2>
As this was my first group computer science project in college, I had a lot to learn about working with other people to finish a relatively large project. Everyone has different schedules, different things that they are good at, different work ethics, and many other variables that have to be taken into account. Sometimes it felt like we were meeting too much and other times it felt like we weren't communicating enough. As the weeks went on, we got used to meeting about twice a week in class and once or twice a week outside of class to make sure each member was keeping up with their work. Any time someone got stuck on something, they could ask in the group discord we were using and the other members would try to help solve the problem with up to 4 people thinking instead of just 1. At the end of the project we got everything done that we had planned which was a success to me.
